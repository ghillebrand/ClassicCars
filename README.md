# ClassicCars
A SQLite version of the classic MySQL tutorial database from [mysqlTutorial](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql/mysql-sample-database/), 
created by running it through the [mysql2sqlite]([url](https://github.com/dumblob/mysql2sqlite)) tool.
Easiest to play with using the [litecli](https://litecli.com/) tool.

See a longer post around this on my [blog](https://isijingi.co.za/wp/2024/11/10/classic-cars-for-sqlite/).
